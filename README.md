# Development timeline:

This is a complex software, and we will implement the suggested functionality incrementally, as we use it.

- We will start with re-flowing UI, Redux, User management, and DB (1 month)
- New modules implementation: Tables management, Classifier management, Ontology management, Search (1.5 months)
- Unpivotr, Metamap, Software Repacking, Usage stats module (2 weeks)
