<p><span class="font6">Given the disruptive effects of relapses on the lives of patients with schizophrenia and the high cost of&nbsp;inpatient treatment, tertiary prevention is a major&nbsp;goal of long-term treatment. This aim seems to be&nbsp;achievable since, in the majority of cases, relapse is&nbsp;heralded by early warning signs.<sup>14</sup> A reduction in the&nbsp;risk of rehospitalization via timely pharmacological&nbsp;intervention in the prodromal stage has previously&nbsp;been demonstrated.<sup>15</sup> Such evidence led the Prague&nbsp;Psychiatric Center to develop the early detection and&nbsp;intervention Information Technology-Aided Program&nbsp;of Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia (ITAREPS).<sup>16&nbsp;</sup>A previous mirror-design study indicated that early&nbsp;warning signs of relapse can be identified by&nbsp;ITAREPS and that relapses can be aborted and the&nbsp;hospitalization rate reduced by an appropriate&nbsp;increase in antipsychotic dose within the detected&nbsp;prodromal period.<sup>17</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this article, we present the results of an international multicenter trial of the ITAREPS program. The study involved a 1-year prospective, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind controlled trial carried out at 35 outpatient psychiatric centers in the&nbsp;Czech Republic (29 sites) and in the Slovak Republic&nbsp;(6 sites). Investigators were psychiatrists from state,&nbsp;county, and private outpatient facilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The study was designed to test the effectiveness of early pharmacological intervention upon occurrence&nbsp;of early warning signs detected by ITAREPS in outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were at a high risk of relapse. Other&nbsp;psychosocial and supportive interventions were not&nbsp;the focus of the trial. The primary endpoint of this&nbsp;trial was the difference between the active and control groups in the 12-month survival without hospitalization due to relapse of psychosis. The secondary&nbsp;endpoints were differences in a) the number of inpatient days, b) direct inpatient costs between the&nbsp;active and the control groups and c) identification of&nbsp;predictors of hospitalization due to relapse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SUBJECTS AND METHODS</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Participants</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The study subjects were men and women 18-60 years of age and their healthy family members. The inclusion criteria were</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6">1. Diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder according to the International Classification of&nbsp;Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10)<sup>18</sup></span></p></li><li>
<p><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font6">2. Increased risk of relapse, defined as having had at&nbsp;least one psychiatric hospitalization for psychosis&nbsp;within the past 3 years and at least two psychiatric&nbsp;hospitalizations for psychosis in total. A higher&nbsp;minimal limit for numbers of hospitalizations&nbsp;would perhaps have given us a more recurrent&nbsp;sample overall. On the other hand, this would have&nbsp;made the recruitment even more difficult and the&nbsp;sample even less generalizable. This is a standard&nbsp;inclusion criterion which was, for example, used in&nbsp;a similar study.<sup>5</sup></span></p></li><li>
<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6">3. Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S)<sup>19&nbsp;</sup>scale score « 3 at baseline</span></p></li><li>

<p><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6">5. Absence of a cognitive disorder (e.g., dementia),&nbsp;mental disorder due to psychoactive substance use,&nbsp;or mental retardation</span></p></li><li>
<p><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font6">6. Presence of a cooperating family member, caregiver, or other person in frequent contact with the&nbsp;patient (at least four times a week) and willing to&nbsp;participate in the trial</span></p></li><li>
<p><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6">7. Access to and ability to use a mobile phone.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">The exclusion criteria were:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6">1. Participation in another relapse prevention program or another interventional clinical trial</span></p></li><li>
<p><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6">2. Poor adherence to treatment (as indicated by a&nbsp;Hayward Compliance Rating Scale score &lt; 2 at&nbsp;baseline).<sup>20</sup></span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">The trial protocol was reviewed and approved by local independent ethics committees according to the&nbsp;regulatory requirements in both participating countries. Informed consent was obtained from each&nbsp;patient and family member before enrolment in the&nbsp;study.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Study Design</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Patients and family members were to complete the 10-item Early Warning Signs Questionnaire<sup>16&nbsp;</sup>(EWSQ-10P patient version and EWSQ-10FM family version, respectively) upon receiving a short message service (SMS) request sent automatically once a&nbsp;week by the ITAREPS computer system to their&nbsp;mobile phones. Scores on each of the 10 items ranged&nbsp;from 0 (no worsening or even improvement of symptoms) to 4 (extreme worsening). All participants then&nbsp;sent their individual EWSQ scores back to the&nbsp;ITAREPS system as a 10-digit SMS message.&nbsp;ITAREPS automatically detected proportional worsening (or a new onset) of prodromal symptoms compared with the previous week's baseline. If a total&nbsp;EWSQ score exceeded a preset score threshold, an&nbsp;automatically generated ALERT e-mail was sent to&nbsp;the treating psychiatrist with a prompt to follow the&nbsp;“per protocol” intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After screening, a 3-week training phase followed, during which all study subjects completed their&nbsp;EWSQs, but no alert announcements were delivered to investigators. After the training period,&nbsp;patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the&nbsp;active and control groups via a centralized computer-based dynamic random allocation method in the&nbsp;remote ITAREPS central database in order to balance the treatment groups across the following&nbsp;stratification variables: age, gender, duration of illness, CGI score, Hayward Medication Compliance&nbsp;Scale score, number of previous hospitalizations,&nbsp;current medication (oral or depot), level of education, and score on the Global Assessment of&nbsp;Functioning (GAF) scale.<sup>21</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After randomization, both groups of patient/family member pairs continued to receive weekly ITAREPS&nbsp;requests for EWSQ scores and to provide their&nbsp;EWSQ results to the system on a regular basis for&nbsp;the 12 months of the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the active group, ITAREPS reported the occurrence of prodromes to the investigators via ALERT emails. This alerting service was completely disabled in the control group. Therefore, in the control group,&nbsp;the investigators detected and reacted to potential&nbsp;signs of psychotic relapse as they would have done&nbsp;prior to enrolment in the study. In addition to protocol-directed intervention in the active group, all&nbsp;patients received routine clinical and medication&nbsp;management with a frequency of visits that was&nbsp;usual in the outpatient clinical settings in which&nbsp;they were being treated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Study subjects and investigators were blind to randomization status and study design (i.e., whether&nbsp;it was parallel or multiple/cross-over). As the investigators were not sure whether they would receive any&nbsp;feedback from ITAREPS, they had to rely on clinical&nbsp;judgment in the case of worsening of a patient's condition, using regular in-label antipsychotic treatment of their own choice with appropriate dose&nbsp;adjustments according to clinical need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the EWSQ score from the patient and/or the respective family member in the active group exceeded the predefined default threshold, an INITIAL&nbsp;ALERT (IA) e-mail was sent to the investigator. This&nbsp;IA was followed by a 3-week ALERT PERIOD (AP),&nbsp;during which subjects were prompted by ITAREPS&nbsp;to return the EWSQs twice weekly and a more conservative score threshold was used. The AP was terminated when six consecutive EWSQ scores showed&nbsp;no further worsening of symptoms. If EWSQ scores&nbsp;exceeded the more conservative threshold at any&nbsp;time during the AP, an ALERT EMERGENCY (AE)&nbsp;was announced to the investigator via e-mail. The AP&nbsp;was also extended for a further 3 weeks after each&nbsp;new AE message. Both the IA and AE thresholds&nbsp;were previously determined to maximize the hospitalization predictive value by evaluating pooled&nbsp;patient data that had been collected in the ITAREPS&nbsp;database since the introduction of the program in&nbsp;clinical practice in 2005.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The core ITAREPS study intervention was a “per protocol” 20% increase in the dose of antipsychotic&nbsp;medication within 24 hours in response to a&nbsp;Pharmacological Intervention Requiring Event&nbsp;(PIRE). A PIRE was defined as either:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6">a) the receipt of any INITIAL ALERT (IA) e-mail. A&nbsp;dose increase was obligatory in such cases regardless of the current clinical status of the patient.</span></p></li><li>
<p><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font6">b) the receipt of an ALERT EMERGENCY (AE) email, after which the investigator confirmed clinical worsening via phone contact with the patient.&nbsp;Phone contact was required by the protocol after&nbsp;the announcement of each IA or AE.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Seventy-two hours following each IA or AE announcement, investigators were prompted via&nbsp;email to complete an unscheduled post-ALERT visit,&nbsp;to assess the clinical change by means of the Clinical&nbsp;Global Impressions-Improvement Scale (CGI-I)&nbsp;(proportional change compared to the last contact&nbsp;before announcement of the current IA or AE), and&nbsp;to record changes in antipsychotic medication (if&nbsp;any) so that the exact nature of the intervention and&nbsp;the investigator's adherence to the protocol could be&nbsp;documented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Three study visits were scheduled after screening: at baseline, month 6, and month 12 (end-of-study&nbsp;visit). All collected data were web-based and investigators were prompted to perform data input via an&nbsp;automatic e-mail containing a direct link to the web&nbsp;page with the relevant case report form.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Measures</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Study assessments included the CGI-S and CGI-I scales,<sup>19</sup> the Hayward 7-item Medication Compliance&nbsp;Rating Scale,<sup>20</sup> and the GAF scale<sup>21</sup> at baseline,&nbsp;month 6, and the end-of-study visit. Demographic&nbsp;data and the history of illness were obtained at baseline. CGI scores, dates of hospitalization, dose of&nbsp;antipsychotic medication and any changes, hospitalization due to relapse, and also relapse without subsequent hospitalization were recorded at each&nbsp;outpatient appointment. Relapse without hospitalization was defined as a CGI-I &gt; 6, self-injury, suici-dal/homicidal ideation, or violent behavior.<sup>22</sup></span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Statistical Analyses</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In order to detect a 20% difference in the 12-month hospitalization-free survival with a one-sided type I&nbsp;error of 5% and a power of 90%, we estimated that&nbsp;150 patients had to be enrolled in the study (75 per&nbsp;group). For power analysis, we used data from the&nbsp;previous ITAREPS mirror-design study.<sup>17</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the intention-to-treat and as-treated analyses, we estimated the cumulative probability of remaining free of hospitalization due to relapse using the&nbsp;Kaplan-Meier method and compared this variable&nbsp;with log-rank statistics. An overall risk difference&nbsp;and risk ratios were calculated at the end of the&nbsp;study with 95% confidence intervals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We conducted an intention-to-treat analysis that included all randomized patients. Post-hoc analyses&nbsp;(as-treated analysis and Cox proportional hazards&nbsp;regression) were performed to examine the effect of&nbsp;the specific ITAREPS-mediated intervention (i.e.,&nbsp;antipsychotic dose increase upon announcement of a&nbsp;PIRE). Therefore, subjects with no prodromal signs&nbsp;detected by ITAREPS during the course of the study&nbsp;(prodrome negatives, PNs) were excluded from these&nbsp;analyses. An as-treated analysis was carried out&nbsp;with stratification by the PIRE+ variable. PIRE+&nbsp;was defined as the proportion of PIREs followed by&nbsp;the “per protocol” required antipsychotic dose&nbsp;increase out of the total number of PIREs released&nbsp;for the given patient during the study. The stratification by PIRE+ was implemented irrespective of the&nbsp;patients' assignment to either the active or the control group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Post-hoc Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the effects of multiple&nbsp;potential risk factors for hospitalization due to&nbsp;relapse in the whole sample during the 1-year study.&nbsp;The following independent variables were used: age&nbsp;at baseline, gender, number of hospitalizations and&nbsp;duration of illness, level of education, age at the&nbsp;onset of illness, baseline CGI-S score, diagnosis&nbsp;(schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder), baseline&nbsp;Hayward Medication Compliance Scale score, baseline GAF score, formulation of medication at entry&nbsp;into the study (oral or depot), patient/family member&nbsp;adherence with ITAREPS (for definition see below),&nbsp;and whether the antipsychotic dose was appropriately increased according to the protocol (PIRE+). We&nbsp;used 95% confidence intervals to indicate the precision of the hazard ratios obtained via these analyses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Clinical characteristics, number of days hospitalized, length of prodromal symptom periods, and direct costs of treatment were compared in univariate analyses using the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for&nbsp;categories. The costs of psychiatric hospitalization&nbsp;were based on direct daily costs covered in 2009 by&nbsp;Czech health insurance companies. Cost data were&nbsp;converted to Euros (EUR).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RESULTS</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Study population</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">We screened 442 patients between April, 2008, and February 2009 (Figure 1). In 251 cases, either the&nbsp;patient or the family member refused to participate&nbsp;in the study, and an additional 33 patients were&nbsp;excluded because they did not meet inclusion criteria. Thus, 158 patients were randomly assigned to&nbsp;one of two study groups. Twelve of these subjects&nbsp;withdrew consent early in the study, so that the&nbsp;dropout rate due to withdrawal of consent was 7.6%&nbsp;per year (5% in the active and 10.1% in the control&nbsp;group, respectively). These 12 patients withdrew&nbsp;before any prodromal symptoms were detected by&nbsp;ITAREPS. Therefore, the total number of patients in&nbsp;the study (intention-to-treat population) was 146 (75&nbsp;in the active and 71 in the control group). Both&nbsp;groups were similar in terms of baseline variables&nbsp;(Table 1). In total, 25 of the 35 investigators had both</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">active and control patients in their registries</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the 1-year study, participants sent a total of 17,082 SMSs (8741 in the&nbsp;active and 8341 in the control group) in&nbsp;response to 21,208 automatically generated ITAREPS prompts. Overall, the&nbsp;return rate was 80% (active = 79.8%, controls = 81.3%). In the active group,&nbsp;ITAREPS detected and announced 1,146&nbsp;alerts (either INITIAL ALERTS or&nbsp;ALERT EMERGENCIES), representing&nbsp;13.1% of all SMS messages received in&nbsp;this study arm. Of these 1,146 alerts, 149&nbsp;required immediate pharmacological&nbsp;intervention according to the study protocol and thus fell into the category of a&nbsp;pharmacological intervention requiring&nbsp;event (PIRE). In the control group,&nbsp;ITAREPS detected 1,911 alert events&nbsp;representing 22.9% of all SMS messages&nbsp;received.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Adherence to the Protocol</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Subject adherence to ITAREPS. </span><span class="font6">Thirty subjects (20.5% of all those who&nbsp;were randomized; 13.3% in the active&nbsp;and 28.2% in the control group) met predefined criteria for non-adherence to&nbsp;ITAREPS (i.e. patient/family member&nbsp;responded to fewer than 70% of SMS&nbsp;prompts).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Investigator protocol adherence.</span><span class="font6"> The adherence of investigators to the protocol was poor in the active group. Despite&nbsp;protocol-directed therapy, the antipsychotic dose was increased in response to&nbsp;only 58&nbsp;&nbsp;(39%) of 149 PIREs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Investigators reported the following reasons for their failure to perform the required pharmacological intervention&nbsp;in the case of the other PIREs </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(n</span><span class="font6"> = 91):&nbsp;clinical inappropriateness of dose&nbsp;increase according to investigator's judgment (64.9% of all cases), patient's&nbsp;refusal to comply with higher doses&nbsp;(15.5%), inability to contact the patient&nbsp;(6.2%), inability to increase the dose due</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">to medication side effects (6.2%), inability to increase the dose since the maximum recommended dose had&nbsp;already been reached (4.1%), and risk resulting from&nbsp;rapid dose increase in the case of consecutive&nbsp;announcements of PIREs in the given patient (3.1%).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ITAREPS identified early warning signs of relapse at least once during the course of the study in 67% of&nbsp;active patients (Active Prodrome Positives; APP, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font6"> =&nbsp;50), whereas 33% of the active patients remained free&nbsp;of early warning signs (Active Prodrome Negatives;&nbsp;APN, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font6"> = 25). The system identified a similar proportion (63%) of patients with early warning signs in the&nbsp;control group (Control Prodrome Positives; CPP, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font6"> =&nbsp;45). However, more alerts were issued for individual&nbsp;patients in the control group, accounting for the higher number of alerts overall in that group (1911 versus&nbsp;1146 in the active group). The prevalence of the investigators' failure to increase the antipsychotic dose in&nbsp;response to a PIRE (at least one omission to increase&nbsp;dose according to the protocol occurred in 44% of&nbsp;active patients) meant that APP patients varied in&nbsp;terms of the PIRE+ ratio (i.e., proportion of PIREs followed by a dose increase out of the total number of&nbsp;PIREs for a given patient).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For post-hoc analyses, we arbitrarily divided the APP patients into two categories: ITAREPS&nbsp;Algorithm-Adherers (IAAs, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font6"> = 25 for whom more&nbsp;than 50% of PIREs were followed by the required&nbsp;dose increase), and ITAREPS Algorithm-Neglectors&nbsp;(IANs, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font6"> = 25 for whom fewer than 50% of PIREs&nbsp;were followed by the required dose increase). The&nbsp;rationale behind this “all-or-nothing” categorization&nbsp;was the fact that 83% of prodrome-positive subjects&nbsp;from the pooled study sample followed a dichotomous distribution of PIRE+ values (i.e., the “per protocol” required pharmacological intervention was&nbsp;carried out in either 100% or 0% of all PIREs&nbsp;released for those patients during the study).&nbsp;Obviously, the PIRE+ ratio in prodrome-positive controls was always zero. In the remaining 17% of active&nbsp;patients (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font6"> = 16), in whom the PIRE+ varied from&nbsp;14% to 75%, a mid-distribution dichotomous 50%&nbsp;cut-off point for either “ITAREPS AlgorithmAdherers” (IAAs) or “ITAREPS Non-Interventional&nbsp;individuals” (INIs) allocation was used, since an&nbsp;equal number of patients (8 subjects) fell either&nbsp;below or above this value. However, we are fully&nbsp;aware that one of the main study flaws results from&nbsp;the fact that allocation to the IAA and INI groups&nbsp;was not predefined in the study protocol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A logistic regression model with ”investigator adherence” as dependent variable did not show any&nbsp;relation between study site or clinical and patient&nbsp;demographic variables and investigator non-adher-ence within the active group. In addition, no differences in clinical and demographical variables were&nbsp;found between IAAs and IANs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Intention-to-treat analysis.</span><span class="font6"> In the ITT population (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font6"> = 146), 13 of the 75 patients in the active group&nbsp;(17.3%) were hospitalized due to relapse of psychosis&nbsp;compared with 12 of the 71 patients (16.9%) in the&nbsp;control group. No statistically significant differences&nbsp;were found in patient survival between the active and&nbsp;the control groups using the Kaplan-Meier method&nbsp;plus the log-rank test (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05; 95%&nbsp;confidence interval [CI] 0.48-2.30; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span class="font6"> = 0.9, Figure 2A).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">As-treated analysis.</span><span class="font6"> In the post-hoc as-treated analysis, we focused on the primary outcome according to the intervention actually received. In order to&nbsp;assess the direct preventive effect of the ITAREPS-triggered pharmacological intervention, only subjects&nbsp;from both the active and the control groups with early&nbsp;warning signs detected by the system (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font6"> = 95) were&nbsp;included, while all prodrome-negative subjects from&nbsp;both arms (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font6"> = 51) were excluded from the analysis. In&nbsp;this analysis, ITAREPS Algorithm-Adherers (IAAs, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">= 25) were compared with a virtual control group consisting of ITAREPS Algorithm-Neglectors (IANs, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font6"> =&nbsp;25) and Control Prodrome-Positives (CPPs, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font6"> = 45).&nbsp;IANs + CPPs constituted a pooled virtual ITAREPS&nbsp;Non-Interventional group (INIs, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font6"> = 70).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Kaplan-Meier survival estimation using the logrank test showed statistically significant differences in patient survival according to therapy, with significantly better hospitalization-free survival for IAAs (1&nbsp;of 25 patients hospitalized [4%]) compared with the&nbsp;INI group (22 of 70 hospitalized [31%]; HR 0.11, 95%&nbsp;CI 0.05-0.28, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span class="font6"> = 0.009; number needed to treat&nbsp;[NNT] = 4, 95% CI 3-10) (Figure 2B).</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DISCUSSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">This study was an investigator-initiated multicenter trial using the ITAREPS program to prevent&nbsp;relapse in schizophrenia. In the primary intention-to-treat analysis, our&nbsp;results showed no difference in the&nbsp;hospitalization-free survival rate&nbsp;between the active and the control&nbsp;groups. However, this was largely a&nbsp;failed study, because investigators&nbsp;adhered to the protocol by increasing&nbsp;the antipsychotic dose in only a&nbsp;minority (39%) of PIREs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although the trial could not achieve its stated goals, we considered it important to report our</span></p><div style="border:solid;"><img src="Španiel et al. - 2012 - Effect_files/60paniel et al. - 2012 - Effect-4.png" alt="" style="width:301pt;height:600pt;"></div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">results for several reasons. First, our findings underline the difficulties that may arise due to the indistinct phenomenology of early warning signs. The most common reason (65%) given by investigators for&nbsp;not responding to the PIREs was that, based on clinician's judgment, the severity of the early warning&nbsp;signs did not justify prompt pharmacological intervention, even though failure to increase the antipsychotic dose required deviation from the protocol. The&nbsp;literature on the nature of prodromal symptoms suggests that early warning signs of relapse are subtle,&nbsp;with generally very small mean elevations of objective measures of psychopathology.<sup>23-26</sup> In this study,&nbsp;the median CGI-I score in all PIREs was 5, reflecting&nbsp;only minimal worsening of the clinical status. A dose&nbsp;increase of 20% is clinically significant, especially in&nbsp;light of the absence of substantial decline in symptomatology and thus questionably acceptable to treating psychiatrists. This factor plausibly undermined&nbsp;investigators' adherence to the dose increase&nbsp;requirement. To sum up, psychiatrists are probably&nbsp;generally reluctant to react pharmacologically to&nbsp;such minor subclinical signs of relapse because they&nbsp;prefer to rely on their clinical instinct. This was also&nbsp;supported by the fact that PIREs followed by pharmacological intervention had significantly higher&nbsp;CGI-I scores (mean 5.09, SD 0.65) compared with&nbsp;PIREs with no intervention (mean 4.57, SD 1.09, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span class="font6"> =&nbsp;0.00005, Z = 4.07, Mann-Whitney U test).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Second, unexpectedly high investigator non-adher-ence to the protocol in the active arm affected the results of the Cox regression model. The strongest&nbsp;predictor of hospitalization was the absence of pharmacological intervention after ITAREPS prodrome&nbsp;detection (PIRE). There was an 11-fold increase in&nbsp;the hospitalization risk in patients in the whole prodrome-positive sample who received no antipsychotic&nbsp;dose increase in response to PIREs. The analysis also&nbsp;showed a protective effect of female gender and of&nbsp;higher education against the risk of inpatient admission, which is consistent with previous reports.<sup>27,28</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To assess the effectiveness of the core ITAREPS “per protocol” pharmacological intervention, an&nbsp;exploratory post-hoc as-treated analysis was carried&nbsp;out in the sample of patients in whom early warning&nbsp;signs were detected by the system. This showed a&nbsp;significant effect of patient stratification according to&nbsp;the presence or absence of an antipsychotic dose&nbsp;increase in response to the ITAREPS-identified prodromes classified as PIRE. As-treated analysis comparing the IAAs and the INIs demonstrated that an&nbsp;antipsychotic dose increase upon receipt of the&nbsp;ITAREPS PIRE significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization due to relapse, and decreased the number of inpatient days and the direct costs of inpatient&nbsp;care (secondary outcomes). However, the post-hoc as-treated approach represents a substantial limitation&nbsp;of the trial, compromising the generalizability of the&nbsp;findings. Therefore, the results should be considered&nbsp;indicative rather than conclusive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Despite antipsychotic dose increases in the IAA group, no significant differences were seen between&nbsp;the IAA and INI groups in the mean daily outpatient&nbsp;antipsychotic medication costs nor the mean daily&nbsp;outpatient antipsychotic dose in chlorpromazine&nbsp;equivalents<sup>29</sup> (Table 2), probably due to the complex&nbsp;dynamic of dose manipulations. Relatively frequent&nbsp;dose adjustments were made in response to&nbsp;ITAREPS alerts in the IAA group, although those&nbsp;episodes were relatively short. Concurrently, in the&nbsp;INI group, there were few but prolonged episodes of&nbsp;dose increases that typically followed previously&nbsp;ignored alerts. This was probably in response to an&nbsp;apparent progressive decline in clinical state. Thus,&nbsp;those different approaches may have led to a similar&nbsp;chlorpromazine equivalent dose load in both groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In summary, intention-to-treat analysis did not yield a significant difference between treatment&nbsp;groups defined by the protocol in this trial. The study&nbsp;showed low psychiatrist adherence with the ITAREPS&nbsp;algorithm, which we believe reflects psychiatrists'&nbsp;lack of confidence in warning methods based on rating&nbsp;scales and information technology. In this respect, we&nbsp;speculate that investigators did not want to surrender&nbsp;their authority and treatment to an impersonal&nbsp;machine-like procedure. However, this conclusion&nbsp;remains speculative, since qualitative data on investigators' and users' perception of the ITAREPS were&nbsp;not available in this study. Nevertheless, the findings&nbsp;taken together provide an incentive for further development of the system. The predictive power of the&nbsp;EWSQ score thresholds has recently been substantially improved, using a cybernetic, machine learning&nbsp;approach, so that the number of false negative alerts&nbsp;has been reduced by 40%. Based on the experience we&nbsp;have gained, we are currently controlling for an action&nbsp;taken after an alert delivery in a new version of the&nbsp;program, ITAREPS 2.0, in which psychiatrists are&nbsp;instructed to announce electronically (upon automatic email prompt) the type of pharmacological intervention or the reason for absence of dose increase.&nbsp;Since the study presented here showed an absence of&nbsp;detailed information on baseline symptoms due to&nbsp;exclusive use of the CGI to characterize the sample,&nbsp;two ITAREPS studies that are now underway are&nbsp;using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale&nbsp;(PANSS)<sup>30</sup> to better evaluate the feasibility of the&nbsp;method within heterogeneous patient populations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This study also suggested innovative ways of further exploiting this telemedicine technology. We can see promising potential for the program in the evaluation of long-term clinical characteristics of different&nbsp;antipsychotic medications as measured by means of&nbsp;EWSQ fluctuations as a proxy for clinical stability.&nbsp;Therefore, ITAREPS may also have a role in the provision of personalized treatment. Implementation of&nbsp;the ITAREPS in the context of intensive case management would also be fruitful, although it was not&nbsp;possible to investigate that question in this study&nbsp;given the lack of those services in the Czech Republic.&nbsp;We would also expect to find that a combined&nbsp;approach that employed both pharmacological and&nbsp;psychosocial measures in relapse prevention would&nbsp;be superior to either strategy alone. These, among&nbsp;other issues, will be addressed in future studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our goal in this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using a simple preventive algorithm based on antipsychotic dose modifications, to be administered&nbsp;within the common constraints imposed by an outpatient treatment milieu. Our findings indicate that&nbsp;implementing this novel approach to relapse prevention in clinical practice will remain challenging unless&nbsp;validated computerized methods gain acceptance and&nbsp;a substantial change in clinical thinking is achieved.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Our results suggest that a relapse prevention program based on telecommunication technologies may represent a novel, cost-effective, and simple method&nbsp;for reducing disease burden and direct inpatient&nbsp;costs in schizophrenia. The study presented here provided a framework for further investigation of a&nbsp;refined concept of the ITAREPS system.</span></p>
